# YAGNI: You ain’t gonna need it

That principle is not telling us how to do something in code directly, but rather how to code effectively.
In general it says that we should code only things that are required from us in this particular moment.

For example: when we will have to do validation of email and password field, we shouldn’t do validation of name, because we may never need it.
It is really as TDD : we write test only for micro feature and write minimal code required to work on that.
`YAGNI` is trying to save us time and focus on most important things in our sprint.
