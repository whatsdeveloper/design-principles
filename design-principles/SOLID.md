# SOLID (object-oriented design)

| principle                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S**ingle responsibility | A class should have only a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class. |
| **O**penâ€“closed           | Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.                                                             |
| **L**iskov substitution   | Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.                                                |
| **I**nterface segregation | Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.                                                                                               |
| **D**ependency inversion  | One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."                                                                                                                    |
